# MLP-based classification of liver disorders

This Jupyter Notebook was developed as an assignment for a class I took in my Master's program.

This Jupyter Notebook trains an MLP model on tabular data from blood tests, to classify on liver disorders.
Source dataset is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/60/liver+disorders

The script uses Sci-kit Learn to split the dataset into training and evaluation sets, finally measuring
the models accuracy. The notebook also contains notes I made comparing its result to the one from a previous 
assigment, in which we used an ensemble of classic Machine Learning models in similar classification tasks.
